        In 2018, I embarked on my journey into web development by enrolling in
        online courses available on platforms such as Udemy, YouTube, and
        Skillshare. As a self-taught developer concurrently pursuing my
        bachelor's degree in mathematics, I dedicated myself to acquiring the
        necessary skills. After a few months of diligent study, I gained
        confidence in my abilities and began freelancing on platforms like
        Upwork and Freelancer.com. This experience allowed me to collaborate
        directly with clients on real-life projects, thereby honing my skills
        and gaining valuable professional experience.

        In 2019, following several months of freelancing, I transitioned to
        working with a company on a contractual basis. During this period, I
        managed to balance my studies and part-time commitments alongside my
        employment. Working directly with the company provided me with valuable
        opportunities to contribute to numerous high-level projects, expanding
        my skill set and knowledge of advanced techniques and technologies.
        Moreover, I dedicated personal time to learning new stacks, such as
        Next.js, GraphQL, and other relevant technologies, further enriching my
        expertise.

        extensively utilized technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Express for
